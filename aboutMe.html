                <h2>My name is Anna and prioritizing needs saved my life</h2>

                <p><strong>I am a jack of all trades</strong>. I have picked up many skills
                    in my life and it has caused me to have a lack of direction.</p>
                <p>Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't want to live 
                    in, and relationship issues.</p>

                <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
                <p><strong>I was on the verge of a breakdown when I put my health and finances first</strong>. 
                    I decluttered my house and I quit my job. I enrolled in online courses to learn
                    computer programming</p>
                <p>It wasn't easy at all, but I was at a loss and needed to change kmy life trajectory.</p>

                <h3>Now I live a better life</h3>
                <p>Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I have goals 
                    and it is easier to focus keeping those in mind.
                </p>
                <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choice
                     but to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from 
                     putting yourself first, which is why I started this site!</p>
